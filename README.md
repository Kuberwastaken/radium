## Credits
### ungoogled-chromium
Radium is proudly based on [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium).
It wouldn't be possible for us to get rid of Google's bloat and get a development+building pipeline this fast without it.
Huge shout-out to everyone behind this amazing project!
(and we intend to contribute even more stuff upstream in the future)

### The Chromium project
[The Chromium Project](https://www.chromium.org/) is obviously at the core of Radium,
making it possible to exist in the first place.
